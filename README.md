# Student-Management-System
📄 Description
The Student Management System is a simple and easy-to-use web application developed using PHP and MySQL to help educational institutions manage student information efficiently. This system allows an admin to add, edit, and delete student records through a user-friendly web interface.
It can be used to maintain essential details like student name, roll number, class, contact info, and more. The system is designed to demonstrate CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) and basic authentication in PHP with a MySQL database. It serves as a great mini-project for students who are learning PHP, web development, and database integration.
This project also includes a responsive design using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap, making it accessible on both desktop and mobile browsers.
